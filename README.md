# OS Certificate Store

Import intermediate certificates from the Windows certificate manager into the QGIS certificate store.

## Installation

To install the latest version of the plugin:

- Clone this repository or download and unzip the latest code of the plugin

- If you do not have `paver` (https://github.com/paver/paver) installed, install it by typing the following in a console:

    ```
    pip install paver
    ```

- Open a console in the folder created in the first step, and type

    ```
    paver setup
    ```

This will get all the dependencies needed by the plugin.

- Install into QGIS by running

    ```
    paver install
    ```

That will copy the code into your QGIS user plugin folder, or create a symlink in it, depending on your OS

To package the plugin, run

```
paver package
```

Documentation will be built in the `docs` folder and added to the resulting zip file. It includes dependencies as well, but it will not download them, so the `setup` task has to be run before packaging.

## Usage

Usage is documented in [docs/source/usage.rst](docs/source/usage.rst).
